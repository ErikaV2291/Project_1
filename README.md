 ## Restaurant Website

This is my first website written from code. As a graphic designer, I have designed many websites, but this is the first time that I've had the opportunity to translate my vision into a reality using code.  

### Overview
This is a basic website highlighting a fictional restaurant. I chose the images first. I wanted to get a theme for the restaurant and match the color palette to the images and the feel of the restaurant. I named it Montserrat Ristorante after the main font that I used for the text.

### User stories

### Technologies Used

### Future additions
I would like to add more information and images to the site. I would like to add a form for making a reservation online and a map that would give users directions to the restaurant.
